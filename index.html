                    <h1>All Highlights<br>
                        Copa America 2024</h1>
                    <p>The CONMEBOL Copa América, often simply called the Copa America (America Cup in english), is the top men's                               quadrennial football tournament contested among national teams from South America. It is the oldest still-running                        continental football competition, as well as the third most watched in the world.
                       Eight of the ten CONMEBOL national teams have won the tournament at least once in its 47 stagings since the                              event's inauguration in 1916, with  Ecuador and Venezuela the only teams yet to win. Argentina and Uruguay have                          the most championships in the tournament's history, with 15 cups each. The country that hosted the tournament the                        most times (nine editions) is Argentina, including the inaugural edition in 1916. The United States is the only                          non-CONMEBOL country that hosted the event, having done so in both 2016 and 2024. On three occasions (in 1975,                           1979, and 1983), the tournament was held in multiple South American countries. Since 1993, the tournament has                            generally featured 12 teams — all 10 CONMEBOL teams and two additional teams from other confederations. Mexico                           participated in every tournament between 1993 and 2016, with one additional team drawn from CONCACAF, except for                         1999, when AFC team Japan filled out the 12-team roster, and 2019, which featured Japan and Qatar. The 2016                              version of the event, Copa América Centenario, featured 16 teams, with six teams from CONCACAF in addition to the                        10 from CONMEBOL. Mexico's two runner-up finishes are the highest for a non-CONMEBOL side.</p>
